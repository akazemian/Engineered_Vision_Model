# Engineered_Vision_Model
biologically inspired learning-free PyTroch vision models. 

The models/model_layers folder includes the operations that can be added to the model, each of which is a separate nn-Module. The models/call_model.py script calls the latest version of the engineered model, as seen in models/engineered_model.py.
